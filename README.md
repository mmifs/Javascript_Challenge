# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

This password generator can create passwords featuring lowercase, uppercase, numeric and special characters from 8 - 128 characters in length.

The password generator will prompt the user to select a length for the password and choose what types of characters to be included in the password from the four categories listed above, and then display the password on the page.

Should the user select an invalid length (anything that is not a number, or not between 8 - 128), the webpage will prompt the user to try again.

Should the user not select any categories for the characters, the webpage will prompt the user to select at least one category.
